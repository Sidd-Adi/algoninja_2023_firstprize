# AlgoNinja 2023 Winning Algorithm Trading Strategies
## 🏆 1st Prize Winner at AlgoNinja 2023
### Event organized by IIT Bombay and FinDoc

This repository contains the code and resources that won 1st Prize at the AlgoNinja 2023 algorithm trading competition. The competition had three challenging rounds that tested the understanding of markets, strategy creation, and implementation through backtesting on real-world data.

## 💡 Competition Overview
AlgoNinja 2023 was a prestigious multi-round competition that required participants to design and implement algorithmic trading strategies. The competition was divided into three rounds:

## Round 1: Strategy Proposal (High-Level)
Participants submitted a high-level presentation explaining their strategy, knowledge of the market, and trading insights. My submission included a robust strategy to leverage market opportunities using historical data analysis and statistical models.

## Round 2: Hedge Fund Flowchart
In this round, participants were required to submit a detailed flowchart showing how their strategy would work within a hedge fund. This included entry/exit points, risk management, and overall fund strategy.

## Round 3: Strategy Implementation
In the final round, participants were provided with a dataset containing 1-minute OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data of a stock or cryptocurrency. I designed and implemented three different trading strategies, each using unique timeframes and methodologies. The strategies were backtested using Python to ensure profitability and effectiveness.

## ⚙️ Project Structure
The repository contains the following key files and directories:

- /strategy_ppt/: High-level strategy proposal (Round 1).
- /flowchart/: Hedge fund flowchart submission (Round 2).
- /code/: Python scripts for implementing and backtesting trading strategies (Round 3).
- /data/: Dataset used for backtesting (OHLC 1-min data).
- /results/: Backtesting results and performance reports included in the final presentation showcased by me at IIT Bombay, December 27th 2023.

## 📊 Strategies Implemented
The following strategies were implemented and backtested for the competition:

- Strategy 1: Long-term swing strategy using daily/weekly timeframes for more stable, less frequent trades.
- Strategy 2: Short-term trading strategy focused on minute-by-minute data analysis. 
- Strategy 3: Mid-term strategy leveraging a combination of technical indicators and historical price movements.
- 
Each strategy was backtested against the provided dataset, with results showing significant profitability and risk-adjusted returns in the final presentation.
